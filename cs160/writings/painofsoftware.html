            <br>
            <p>When I read this, I thought back to the old saying “there is more than one way to skin a cat”. This is something that really crosses my mind a lot when I’m working on my projects. When you start building software, you have absolutely nothing besides the framework you’re using, the tools they give you, and a blank sheet. You have a very vague visual of what the end result of your app will look like, but you have no idea how to reach that end result, but yet you could conceivably build the exact same software millions of different ways. So the overarching question is: which way to go? It seems like every design team (no matter how big, 1 to infinity), comes across this question. And it’s one of the ways why it feels like getting the ball rolling on software development is so hard. Because the less code you have, the more questions you have to answer. And even though at the end of a development cycle, it may seem more obvious which courses to take, it’s still incredibly hard because you’re being strangled by the constraints you set for yourself at the beginning of your development.</p>
