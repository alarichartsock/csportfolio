Every computer is encoded in binary at a fundamental level out of necessity. If computers were encoded with more than 2 states, then it would become incredibly hard to keep fault tolerance given electronic and radio interference.

Boolean algebra is the foundation of all modern computing. We can create different logic gates with transistors, each with an expected output. When we arrange them together in wacky ways (hello half adder and full adder), we can create devices that do math.
