## Registers and RAM

Persistent memory: 

RAM has been built up on latches, more specifically gated latches. An AND-OR latch is a circuit that takes in two values and outputs a single persistent value. The action of putting a value into memory is called reading, whereas the action of getting data out is called reading. 

A gated latch is a circuit that has two inputs, a data in and a write enable in.
