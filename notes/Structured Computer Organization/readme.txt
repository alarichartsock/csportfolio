Hi, it's Alaric. I read Structured Computer Organization during Spring 2020 as a self learning exercise to more familiarize myself with computer hardware in preparation for more rigorous coursework at Oregon State University in Corvallis. My aim in reading the book wasn't to have an extremely solid understanding of how hardware worked, but to bridge my understanding between what I understand about higher level languages into what is actually happening in the silicon.
