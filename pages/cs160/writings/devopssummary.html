                This article has a lot of corporate jargon to it. I think it makes the mission statement bland, tasteless & unconvincing. But I agree with the overall message: that software disruptors have to move fast & innovate quickly in order to avoid being left behind. Other things like having the majo            Maybe this is more of a critique of the article than DevOps itself, but could this statement get anymore vague? I’ve never seen the english language be used so inefficiently before. This entire paragraph could be summed up as “DevOps uses all sorts of tools in the development process. But we don’t solely rely on just the tools we use”. But this isn’t even something that needs to be said in the first place. Every developer uses tools, so maybe they could get a little specific about what they’re talking about. </p>

                <p>" DevOps relies heavily on automation—and that means you need tools. Tools you build. Tools you buy. Open source tools. Proprietary tools. And those tools are not just scattered around the lab willy-nilly: DevOps relies on toolchains to automate large parts of the end-to-end software development and deployment process.

                The only caveat: Because DevOps tools are so amazingly awesome, there’s a tendency to see DevOps as just a collection of tools. While it’s true that DevOps relies on tools, DevOps is much more than that. " </p>
