ALU - Arithmetic and Logic Unit

The ALU is where all of the computation within a computer is carried out. The intel 74181 is the most famous ALU of all time.

The half adder can be created by adding an XOR and AND gate together, along with a carry wire to complete logical similarity to an addition operation.

Abstraction: a fundamental theorem of computer science

Full Adder: a component that takes 3 inputs, and outputs a sum and carry if there is one

An overflow occurs when the result of an addition is too large to be represented by the number of bits you are using. This can cause errors and unexpected behavior.
