## Electronic Computing

One of the first computers was the Harvard Mk 1, which was created with an abundance of mechanical relays called transistors. However, it was incredibly slow. The harvard Mk 1 had 3500 relays and failed constantly. Once, a bug was pulled out and that's how the term computer bug got coined.

Vacuum tubes were the original state storing components in early computing of the Harvard Mk 1. 

The Bomb was created by Alan Turing during WW2 to crack the Nazi enigma code (although it wasn't technically a computer). Shortly after, Tommy Flowers created the Colossus Mk 1. 

The Colossus Mk 1 was the first programmable, electronic computer. Early programming was done by hand by plugging hundreds of wires into plugboards.

The ENIAC was completed in 1946 and could perform 5,000 computations per second. It was operational for ten years, and it likely did more computations than the entire human race had up until that point. But its achilles heel was the vacuum tubes that it relied on, which constantly broke down.

In 1947, Bell Laboratory scientists created the electronic transistor. The actual function of these requires an understanding of quantum physics, because electronic transistors can become entangled.
