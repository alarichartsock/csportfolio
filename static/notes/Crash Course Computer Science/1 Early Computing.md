## First Computers 

Originally, computer was just a job title. The first computers were simply humans aided by state storing machines like the abacus, slide rule, and written numbers.

Gottfried Liebnitz built a more complicated state storing machine in 1694, which functioned similar to an odometer. With a clever trick, the step reckoner was modified to perform calculation. This was the first known calculator.

Although the step reckoner was invented, it was prohibitively expensive for the population and most had to rely on pre computed tables for their calculation.

Charles babbage tried to invent the difference engine, a machine which could easily approximate polynomials. This failed, although it was finished in '91 by historians. It weighed 15 tons and has 15,000 components.

Babbage also had plans for the difference engine, which would be a fully fledged computing device with its own printer. Ada Lovelace wrote hypothetical programs for the first hypothetical computer. This would lead to inspire the first generation of what we now know as "computer scientists".

The US census bureau was having a hard time with the prospective 1890 census. The previous census took over 7 years to manually compile, and estimates suggested that the 1890 census would take 13 years to finish (something that is unfortunate for something that is required every 10 years). 

Herman Hollerith created a machine which could automatically tally punched census cards. It was a success, and Herman's machine was 10x faster than manual tabulation.

Hollerith's work eventually merged into IBM with other machines companies.
